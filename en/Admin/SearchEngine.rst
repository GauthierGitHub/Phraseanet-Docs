Configuration inside Phraseanet

After having installed SphinxSearch, Phraseanet must be configured to use it.
Phraseanet admin provides a tool to generate SphinxSearch configuration.

Pour cela, consulter la documentation de configuration
:ref:`search-engine-service-configuration`.

.. note::

    Please note that the generated configuration is a complete SphinxSearch
    configuration. If SphinxSearch is shared with other applications, **server**
    section at the end of the configuration should be removed.

This file can be used with SphinxSearch server (**/usr/local/etc/sphinx.conf**).
Restart SphinxSearch pour appliquer la configuration.
In case of failure, please find `SphinxSearch documentation`_.
