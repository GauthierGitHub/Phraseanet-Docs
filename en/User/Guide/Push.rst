    *Push* and *Feedback* are two actions intended to transmit documents to
    users, whether or not they have originally a Phrasenaet account.

    A *Push* is used to push media toward users. A *Feeback* is intended to
    collect advisory opinion about media from them.

    A `Lists manager`_ allows to create sending lists to answer some
    repetitive sending towards the same users.

The Push
--------

The Push is a submission of documents or selection of documents. Unlike an
email export, the *Push* does not physically transmit documents. It
notifies in the interface, notifies by email, and leave at the users
disposal some media selections that they can consult and eventually download.

Push documents
**************

* **Select one or several documents** in the results display area or in an
  opened basket or story in the work zone.

* **Click on the Push button** of one of the Actions palettes :

In the Push window...

* **Add one or several users** to push toward them the selected documents.

To do so, enter their names, first names or email address in the form
field on the top left of the interface. An auto-completion system is activated
as soon as the third character is entered in order to facilitate users searches.
Once the Phraseanet user is detected in the suggested users list, click on his
name to add him to the sending list.

**To add one or several non registered users** to a sending list, click on the
link **Add a user**.
Fill in at least the mandatory fields (those with an asterisk) then click
on the "Add" button. The contact is created and added to the recipients area and
his account is created.

.. note::

    The users listed in the recipient area can be gathered and saved in the
    sending list.

    To save a sending list, fill in the form located on the left of the
    recipient area then save by clicking on the icon:

    **Users management rights** is required.

* Click on the *Send* button to validate and transmit the Push.

The following form is aimed to give a name and a description to the push. Those
informations will part of the email notification addressed to recipients.
If needed, an acknowledgement receipt of the email if this function is supported
by the recipients mail boxes.

The Validation
--------------

The operating mode is nearly identical to a Push sending. The only difference is
the giving out of additional or optional benefits.

* Select one or several documents in the results display area or an opened
  basket or open a story in the work area.
* Click on the Validation section of the Phraseanet's actions palette of the
  Push menu of a basket or opened story in the work area.

**In the validation window**,

* Select the Phraseanet user(s) who will receive the Validation request. To
  address this request to non-registered users on the application, the operating
  mode is also the same as for a Push.

The increase of additional rights (the *Grant Rights*) works the same way as a
Push. Rights that can be elevated are more dense :

* **The High Definition download** to grant access to the sub-definitions of the
  documents class
* **The contribution** to validation, default option that allows to give an
  opinion on the documents
* **See others** allows the recipient to view the opinions and comments of the
  other users part of the validation

To validate and transmit a Validation request, click on the *Send* button.
A form allows to set the period of validity of a Validation request, and
to give it a friendly name and description, these items are included in the
email received by the recipients.
To request an acknowledgement receipt of the Validation request, check the
appropriate box.

Push or Validation reception
----------------------------

Pushes and Validations are notified in two different ways :

*  By notification in the Production interface
*  By email

Each notification mode has a permanent link allowing to display in Phraseanet
Lightbox. The *Pushes* and *Validations*  received are displayed as received
baskets in the Production work area. They are also regrouped in Phraseanet
Lightbox.
